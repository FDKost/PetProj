## How to look at this project? 👀

---

1. Clone repository in any folder;

```
$git clone https://github.com/FDKost/PetProj 
```
2. Create **postgresql** database with name **cyberpizzaTest**;

```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE cyberpizzaTest;
```
3. Run application with:
    ```
    C:\Users\yfili\Desktop\IdeaProjects\Education>mvn
    C:\Users\yfili\Desktop\IdeaProjects\Education>mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. Login to your local server (using localhost:8080/ url standard);

5. Login in to application using:
   1. login **ttt** password **ttt**;
   2. register new user.

6. To look at admin panel you need to login as administrator (login ttt password ttt) and go to url localhost:8080/**admin**

## Troubleshooting steps and what in the future I will fix and add? 🩹

---

### ❌I create a new user and I cant order anything:

1. go to url localhost:8080/**profile** and enter location address;
2. go to url localhost:8080/**order** and add something to your cart.

This happens because when we creating a **new user**, he dont have a personal address, therefore application cant create order.
Will fix in future.

### ✅ I cant update personal address at my profile:

    SOLVED

### ❌How can I look at my orders?

Right now only users with role ADMIN can look at orders. In future will add this function to authorized users.
